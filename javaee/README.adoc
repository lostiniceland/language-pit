== Java-Enterprise

=== JPA
At the moment JPA is used to implement the repositories defined in the domain-layer.
This may not be optimal for a pure resource-based application since advanced features
like lazy-loading of entites (especially joins) cannot be used as most of the entities
will be exposed via JSON.

.Ways to improve
* make use of Views on the database level
* use plain SQL (or some other framework for more control)
* leverage JPA in some other way


=== Docker

Since JavaEE relies on a application-server hosting the application a Docker container
has been added to the gradle-build.

.Build and run
----
gradlew war buildImage
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 languagepit/javaee:openliberty
curl http://localhost:8080/bikes
----

The environment DERBY_DB_LOCATION can be used to store the embedded database
on a volumne if needed
