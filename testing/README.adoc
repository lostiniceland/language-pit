== End-To-End-Testing using Hiptest

Testing the composition of all services is done with Spock, as in the other java-based projects.
The difference is, that the test-managent is handled by Hiptest (https://hiptest.com/).

The creation and composition is done in the Hiptest-UI. Hiptests uses a construct known as
Actionwords which will be generated as empty skeletons and are implemted manually.
The actual tests are a composition of those actionwords. This way, it is easy to identify
tests which are duplicates or unused actionswords.
