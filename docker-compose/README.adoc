== Apache Kafka

TODO

=== Running

The provided Docker-Compose contains the wurstmeister/kafka image, and is using the Confluent-Platform on top.
Confluent-Platform provides the required REST-proxy for the kafka-topics-ui, which can be used to debug topics
within the cluster.

Connection to Kafka is established via <DOCKER_HOST_IP>:9092 (please refer to wurstmeister docu for why localhost
is not recommeded).
The topics-ui can be easily accessed with http://localhost:8000
